      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Data Science student at the New Jersey Institute of Technology
        with a minor in Applied Physics, focused on applying artificial
        intelligence to problems in astronomy and space physics. My research
        focuses on magnetospheric physics, specifically the propagation of
        Electromagnetic Ion Cyclotron (EMIC) waves from space to ground.
      </p>
      <p>Outside of academia, I love to weight-lift, paint, hike, and read.</p>
